# Notebook

A Steam Deck plugin for the [Decky Plugin Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) that allows you to quickly scribble down (with your finger) notes or reminders you may need during your play sessions.

Nothing beats the real life notebook and pencil to feel like a genuine detective but just in case you forgot yours at home, this may be the next best convenient option.

The plugin stores a notebook per application with 8 pages by default, it will open the right one depending on the currently focused application. A default "Steam" notebook is also available when no application is running.

From the dropdown menu, the pages are sorted by most recent and the relative modification time is displayed.

Clearing/Removing a notebook page requires a second tap to confirm the deletion during a time window of 4 seconds by default to hopefully save yourself from misclicks.

**Hint:** you may need to be slightly slower and more deliberate when making your strokes for them to register properly. Definitely something to check if it can be enhanced.

## Future considerations

Typing notes with the keyboard. The main issue is that the quick access menu closes as soon as the keyboard is up. Opening a separate form may be a solution (I didn't have much success with this idea for now though).
Or a very basic custom keyboard could be built into the space that's occupied by the canvas right now for a touch solution.
